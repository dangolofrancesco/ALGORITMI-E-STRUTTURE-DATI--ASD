# Algorithms and Data Structure 
Computer Science course at Politecnico di Torino
## Description
- Development of knowledge and skills in problem-solving, algorithmic design, data structures, and their implementation in the C language
- Introduction of algorithmic solutions to “classical” problems, their theoretical aspects and foundations, and their implementations in C language
- Advanced aspects of C are introduced and heavily adopted in problem-solving (pointers, dynamic memory allocation, advanced modularity, and Abstract Data Types)
## Acquired Knowledge
- Dynamically allocation memory, using pointers, and dynamic data structures in C language
- Evaluation of algorithm complexity and how to improve efficiency in terms of execution time and/or memory allocation
- Writing standard algorithms to solve fundamental problems such as sorting, searching, etc.
- Manipulation of complex data structures, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, hash tables, and graphs
- Writing modular programs in C language adopting several programming paradigms such as recursive programming, greedy approaches, dynamic programming, and memoization
- Exploiting tools for program development and problem-solving, based on data structures and algorithm design
